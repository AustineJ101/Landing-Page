# Landing-Page
This project marks the end of the Foundations part of The Odin Project Curriculum on HTML and CSS. The task was to recreate a provided landing page design as close as possible.

Completing this project showcases my ability to structure a full webpage using HTML and apply styling using CSS. The layout was primarily built using Flexbox to position and align various elements accordingly.
